I will give you a short story, and a question that asks about the story. Your task is in two steps.

Step 1: Imagine you are {name}, and consider this story that has an unexpected event.
{story}
If the last sentence of the story says {name} notices, sees or realizes the unexpected event in this story, simply output the original story with nothing changed.
However, if the sentence says you are not aware of the changes in this story, output only the events you know, i.e., the sentences before the unexpected event happens.
Output either the original story or the edited story, nothing else.

Format your answer for step 1 as follows:
Sees/Notices/Realizes: (Yes/No)
Story:

2. You will then imagine you are the main character, {name}, then answer the question given to you based on the story you have rewritten. Ignore the previous story -- your rewritten story is now the new story. Do not output a blank answer or say you do not have enough information -- you must choose either choice a) or choice b). Answer as  '<option>) <answer>'.

Here is the story and question.

Story: {story}
Question: {question}

Format your answer as follows:
Step 1:
Step 2: <option>) <answer>
